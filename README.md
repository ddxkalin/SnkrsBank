# Sneakers Bank Application
Sneakers Bank is a trading web platform where you can sell your new shoes or buy the model that you always want. In Sneakers Bank, despite you can brag with your sneaker collection, you can also buy or sell a pair for a price way above the retail price.

The project is a template for connection between sneaeker heads, resellers and junior sneaker heads.
